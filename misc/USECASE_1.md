I wanted to show you something that gets me genuinely excited about graph technology in fraud detection.

Here, you can watch me walk through a real transaction monitoring use case from a proof of value implemented with a major UK bank. They wanted to see how Neo4j could take their fraud capabilities to the next level.

This specific scenario catches "money mule" operations, which involve criminals funnelling money through multiple accounts before entering high-risk jurisdictions.

What makes this powerful:

1. Traverses unlimited relationship hops while filtering in real-time
2. Aggregates during graph traversal (good luck doing that efficiently in SQL!)
3. Applies rolling 30-day windows on the fly
4. Catches precise patterns like transactions within 90-110% of the original amounts

And you could add SOO much more!

Traditional systems would need massive joins and subqueries to even attempt this. Graph? It just works.

If you're curious how graph technology can transform fraud detection, this walkthrough shows exactly what's possible when you think in relationships, not tables.

What fraud detection challenges are you tackling?
